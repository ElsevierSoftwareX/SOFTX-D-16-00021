Dependencies
============

SPGM uses 'scons' for its build-system. On Linux/Unix systems 'scons' can be installed 
using respective package management systems. On Macs, 'scons' can be installed through
'fink' or 'homebrew'. The code has been tested to run on Linux and Mac OSX systems with 
a gcc compiler (version 4.7+) installed. It should, nonetheless, work with earlier but 
relatively recent versions of the gcc compiler.

Compilation
===========
The code can be compiled as follows from the base directory:

scons

The compiled executable should be located in 'build/release/program/spgm', relative to
the base directory.
